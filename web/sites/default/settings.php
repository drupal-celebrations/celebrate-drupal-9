/**
 * @file
 * Drupal site-specific configuration file.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * This file may have been set to read-only by the Drupal installation program.
 * If you make changes to this file, be sure to protect it again after making
 * your modifications. Failure to remove write permissions to this file is a
 * security risk.
 *
 * In order to use the selection rules below the multisite aliasing file named
 * sites/sites.php must be present. Its optional settings will be loaded, and
 * the aliases in the array $sites will override the default directory rules
 * below. See sites/example.sites.php for more information about aliases.
 *
 * The configuration directory will be discovered by stripping the website's
 * hostname from left to right and pathname from right to left. The first
 * configuration file found will be used and any others will be ignored. If no
 * other configuration file is found then the default configuration file at
 * 'sites/default' will be used.
 *
 * For example, for a fictitious site installed at
 * https://www.drupal.org:8080/mysite/test/, the 'settings.php' file is searched
 * for in the following directories:
 *
 * - sites/8080.www.drupal.org.mysite.test
 * - sites/www.drupal.org.mysite.test
 * - sites/drupal.org.mysite.test
 * - sites/org.mysite.test
 *
 * - sites/8080.www.drupal.org.mysite
 * - sites/www.drupal.org.mysite
 * - sites/drupal.org.mysite
 * - sites/org.mysite
 *
 * - sites/8080.www.drupal.org
 * - sites/www.drupal.org
 * - sites/drupal.org
 * - sites/org
 *
 * - sites/default
 *
 * Note that if you are installing on a non-standard port number, prefix the
 * hostname with that number. For example,
 * https://www.drupal.org:8080/mysite/test/ could be loaded from
 * sites/8080.www.drupal.org.mysite.test/.
 *
 * @see example.sites.php
 * @see \Drupal\Core\DrupalKernel::getSitePath()
 *
 * In addition to customizing application settings through variables in
 * settings.php, you can create a services.yml file in the same directory to
 * register custom, site-specific service definitions and/or swap out default
 * implementations with custom ones.

/**
 * Database settings:
 *
 * The $databases array specifies the database connection or
 * connections that Drupal may use.  Drupal is able to connect
 * to multiple databases, including multiple types of databases,
 * during the same request.

 * One example of the simplest connection array is shown below. To use the
 * sample settings, copy and uncomment the code below between the @code and
 * @endcode lines and paste it after the $databases declaration. You will need
 * to replace the database username and password and possibly the host and port
 * with the appropriate credentials for your database system.
 *
 * The next section describes how to customize the $databases array for more
 * specific needs.
 *
 * @code
 * $databases['default']['default'] = array (
 *   'database' => 'databasename',
 *   'username' => 'sqlusername',
 *   'password' => 'sqlpassword',
